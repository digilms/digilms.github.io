While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=just-me-i039m-not-in-the-mood-for-blogging>JUST ME: I'm Not In The Mood For Blogging<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#just-me-i039m-not-in-the-mood-for-blogging>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-13Ro3D8cGS8/UDfl7RD__3I/AAAAAAAAMKQ/LxT-pSkWYXk/s400/4396785-depressed-cartoon-character.jpeg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.k7KRmBI589Vj09BMp1TU_QHaJZ&pid=15.1"' alt="JUST ME: I'm not in the mood for blogging"><p><em>Source: donna-justme.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>mood depressed blogging cartoon just.</p></blockquote><p>When it comes to wallpaper, there are a few things that everyone should consider.
